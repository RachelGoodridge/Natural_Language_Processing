## Wine Recommendations
By: Rachel Goodridge

## Abstract
The purpose of this model is to create a wine recommendation system for wine enthusiasts of all experience levels that allows users to explore new options and effortlessly make decisions about their next wine purchase. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/wine-tasting) includes 49,546 unique wine tastings and descriptions written by sommeliers. Using text preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and topic modeling, I created a content-based filtering system that can be used to find the closest match to any given wine in the dataset. The search can also be narrowed, based on user input, such that the algorithm only returns wines with the specific features requested by the consumer.
